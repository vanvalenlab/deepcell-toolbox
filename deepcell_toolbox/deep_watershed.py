    """Postprocessing function for deep watershed models. Thresholds the inner
    distance prediction to find cell centroids, which are used to seed a marker
    based watershed of the outer distance prediction.

    Args:
        outputs (list): DeepWatershed model output. A list of
            [inner_distance, outer_distance, fgbg].

            - inner_distance: Prediction for the inner distance transform.
            - outer_distance: Prediction for the outer distance transform.
            - fgbg: Prediction for the foregound/background transform.

        min_distance (int): Minimum allowable distance between two cells.
        detection_threshold (float): Threshold for the inner distance.
        distance_threshold (float): Threshold for the outer distance.
        exclude_border (bool): Whether to include centroid detections
            at the border.
        small_objects_threshold (int): Removes objects smaller than this size.

    Returns:
        numpy.array: Uniquely labeled mask.
